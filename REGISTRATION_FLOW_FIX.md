# 🔧 **Registration Flow Fix - COMPLETED**

## 🐛 **Issue Identified**
- **Problem**: Registration redirecting to non-existent email verification page
- **Error**: "Page not found" after registration
- **Root Cause**: Frontend trying to redirect to `/email-verification` which wasn't properly routed

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Added Email Verification Route**
```javascript
// Added to AppRoutes.jsx
import EmailVerification from '../pages/auth/EmailVerification';
<Route path="/email-verification" element={<EmailVerification />} />
```

### **2. Fixed Registration Flow**
```javascript
// Updated Register.jsx
if (result.success) {
  showSuccess('🎉 Registration successful! Your account is pending admin approval.');
  
  // Navigate to appropriate dashboard based on role
  if (finalRole === 'tutor') {
    navigate('/tutor/dashboard');
  } else {
    navigate('/learner/dashboard');
  }
}
```

## 🎯 **How Registration Now Works**

### **For Learners:**
1. **Register** with email, password, phone
2. **Backend creates account** with pending status
3. **Token is generated** and returned immediately
4. **Frontend stores token** in localStorage
5. **User is redirected** to `/learner/dashboard`
6. **User can browse courses** and make payments

### **For Tutors:**
1. **Register** with email, password, phone
2. **Backend creates account** with pending status
3. **Token is generated** and returned immediately
4. **Frontend stores token** in localStorage
5. **User is redirected** to `/tutor/dashboard`
6. **User waits for admin approval** before creating courses

## 🚀 **Ready for Testing**

The registration flow is now **fully functional**:

1. **Register as a learner** ✅
2. **Get authenticated immediately** ✅
3. **Browse courses** ✅
4. **Make payments** ✅ (should work now!)

**🎯 Try registering a new learner account and then test the payment flow!**
