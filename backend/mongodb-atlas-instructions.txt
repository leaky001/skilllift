MongoDB Atlas Connection Fix Instructions:

1. GO TO MONGODB ATLAS:
   - Visit: https://cloud.mongodb.com/
   - Login with your account
   - Select your cluster: cluster0

2. GET THE CORRECT CONNECTION STRING:
   - Click "Connect" on your cluster
   - Choose "Connect your application"
   - Select "Node.js" and version "4.1 or later"
   - Copy the connection string

3. UPDATE YOUR .env FILE:
   Replace the MONGO_URI line with the correct connection string from Atlas

4. ADD YOUR IP TO WHITELIST:
   - Go to "Network Access" in Atlas
   - Click "Add IP Address"
   - Add: 129.222.206.70 (your current IP)
   - Or temporarily add: 0.0.0.0/0 (allow all IPs - less secure)

5. RESTART YOUR SERVER:
   - Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
   - Run: npm run dev

The issue is that the replica set name in the connection string is incorrect.
You need to get the exact connection string from MongoDB Atlas.

Your current IP: 129.222.206.70
