# 🔑 Stream.IO Token Connection Fixed!

## Token Issue Resolved 🎯

**Problem Identified**: 
```
Error: User token is not set. Either client.connectUser wasn't called or client.disconnect was called
```

**Root Cause**: Using `StreamVideoClient` incorrectly - need to call `connectUser()` first before creating calls.

## Fix Applied ✅

### ❌ **Before (Incorrect)**:
```javascript
const client = new StreamVideoClient({ 
  apiKey: streamApiKey,
  token: streamToken  // ❌ Wrong: token in constructor
});

const call = client.call('default', callId);
await call.join(); // ❌ Fails: token not connected
```

### ✅ **After (Correct)**:
```javascript
const client = new StreamVideoClient({ 
  apiKey: streamApiKey,  // ✅ Only API key in constructor
});

// ✅ CRITICAL: Connect user first with token
await client.connectUser({
  id: user._id.toString(),
  name: user.name,
  token: streamToken  // ✅ Token provided in connectUser
});

const call = client.call('default', callId);
await call.join(); // ✅ Now works: user is connected
```

## What This Fixes 🎯

✅ **Token Authentication**: Stream.IO client properly authenticated
✅ **Call Creation**: Host can create calls successfully  
✅ **Call Joining**: Participants can join existing calls
✅ **Connection Success**: No more "User token is not set" errors

## Expected Results 📊

### ✅ Success Console Messages:
- `🚀 CLEAN: Setting up Stream client...`
- `🚀 CLEAN: User connected to Stream`
- `🚀 CLEAN HOST: Creating call...` (for host)
- `🚀 CLEAN PARTICIPANT: Joining existing call...` (for participant)

### ✅ No More Errors:
- ❌ `User token is not set`
- ❌ `Failed to join call (0/1/2)`
- ❌ `Call]: Failed to join call`

### ✅ Working Connection:
- 🎯 Host creates call, waits for participants
- 🎯 Participants join call, see host immediately
- 🎯 Both users have symmetric visibility
- 🎯 Clean event-driven participant updates

## Testing Instructions 🧪

1. **Refresh browser** (if not already done)
2. **Join live class** from both tutor and learner accounts
3. **Expected**: Both should connect successfully
4. **Console**: Clean connection logs without token errors
5. **Result**: Both users see each other symmetrically

**Status: READY FOR TESTING - Token connection fixed! 🔑✅**

The Stream.IO token authentication issue has been resolved, enabling proper call creation and joining for both hosts and participants!
